TEST 1, 
**************************************************
KeySpace, 2^20 (2^10 * 2^11)

Solve it very soon.

Successful Probability, 90% +

TEST 2, 
**************************************************
KeySpace, 2^28 (2^10 * 2^18)

Solve it very soon.

Successful Probability, 50% + (Not very sure and too tired to conduct experiments.)

TEST 3, 
**************************************************
KeySpace, 2^32 (2^11 * 2^21)

Precomputation Time,  7s for 2^11 * 2^13. So 2^21 t/s. Total time 20min.

Chain Reconstruction,  12s for 100 test cases. Disk time costs just 5% ~ 10%. 

Successful Probability, 72%.

Passed 20/31(32) bit tests, successful probability is very high. However, I found when I use parallel, the single process performance will becom bad
